 ## How to use the code:

 Using the code is simple, you just need to select the dataset that you want to have a result from it and then run the code.
 For our case, we have used "Microsoft Visual Studio - Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current / Version 17.6.2" for running the submitted C# desktop application.
 ### Location of the final results:

 Based on the provided comments on the submitted code, the location of the final results will be always on user's desktop.
 ### Name of the output Folder:

 The name of the output folder can be changed before running the code (please refer to the comments provided in the main code file.)
 ### Dataset Naming
 Last but not least, the name of the dataset that needs to be compiled using the submitted application can be easily taken from the provided dataset folder in our submitted file. (that is only for ease of use since the dataset naming is a bit challenging to be typed by user.)
